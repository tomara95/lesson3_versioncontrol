            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is very helpful when working on big projects that require multiple files. In my own works, A VCS is
            extremely helpful because it gives the creator (or multiple creators) unlimited access to different versions of the same project. Even with
            simple essays writers constantly save multiple files because they are not totally sure which version is better. By using a VCS, writers can
            veer off course in their essay without having the inconvenience of saving multiple files. I also think version control systems are incredibly
            helpful when working on a group project. Every individual can work on a certain part of a project and still work on the same part of the
            project as well. Sometimes doing work can overlap, say a person accidentally edits the same part of a file as another group member. Thanks to
            the VCS, it saves both versions and exposes the differences between the two edits, which the group can ultimately choose which ever one fits
            their liking.  There are lots of useful actions that a VCS can automatically do. It keeps track of who changed the files (revision history),
            when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and it can merge changes to the same file. Overall, using a VCS saves lots of 
            time and gets rid of the hassle of saving multiple files.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A GIT is a free version control system (VCS). There are many benefits in using GIT, including every user has a complete copy of
            the repository data stored locally on their machine, everything is local, so you can work offline, there is no single point of failure,
            Processes run much faster, and GIT will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. In my own words, GIT is one of
            the better Version Control Systems, especially if youâ€™re looking for something that is completely free. GIT is easy to use as long as you
            understand their commands. Add, commit, and push. These are the three commands that create the process of changing or working on a file. The
            user will use these commands to commit a new file to their local repository and push the new file to the remote repository for others to use.   </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged: Committed means that the data is
            safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Staged
            means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. The Git commands will help you through
            this process. Commands such as,  Git commit, Git pull, and Git push. These commands help the user control where the file is going, and whether
            or not they want it on the remote or local repository</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. The first one is your Working Directory which holds the
            actual files. The second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made. git
            commit -m "Commit message" Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet. Your changes are now in the HEAD of
            your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute git push origin master If you have not cloned an existing
            repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with git remote add origin <server> Now you are able to
            push your changes to the selected remote server.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Branches</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the "default" branch when you create
            a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion. A single git repository can track
            an arbitrary number of branches, but your working tree is associated with just one of them (the "current" or "checked out" branch), and HEAD
            points to that branch. Overall, a branch is just another file going off-track, but can still be saved to the master branch. The original master
            branch before the branch will also still be accessible.
